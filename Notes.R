## COMMIT OFTEN AND USE USEFUL COMMIT MESSAGES

# so far we only used git locally on this computer
# but we can push it to github to make it remotely accessible
# the first setup of usethis::use_github automatically opens up github
# in the history (clock symbol) we can see which commits were local (HEAD)
# and which were pushed to a remote (origin/master)
